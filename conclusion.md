# Conclusions

As part of this assignment the task was to perform K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning method on the data provided as part of the Iowa gambling task. The research as part of this assignment allowed to find various features about the data during the data exploration phase. As part of the clustering phase of this assignment

### Data Analysis conclusions
The first conclusion that stuck out was the fact that deck 2 was the most selected deck out of all the decks. Deck 2 was considered to be a "bad" deck and reward less compared to decks 3 and 4. It was for this reason I decided to do my cluster analysis on deck selections and totals. The findings of the cluster analysis provided more in-depth answers for this.

### K-means Clustering conclusions
From looking at the cluster analysis in the clustering section of this paper, the main take away is that all studies seem to have similar trends. For example when you look at the cluster plots, the studies that make the most money tend to have the same selection in the cards chosen. For example, the plot for deck 1 shows that a lot of the participants who picked this deck a lot also lost money.

The cluster anaylsis provided does show that participants who selected the good decks, decks 3 and 4, were far more profitable in comparison to the partcipants who selected the "bad" decks the most often (decks 1 and 2). This was not obvious in the initail data exploration section but it became obvious from running the k-means algorithm on the data.

### Future work
The data that is used as part of this experiment can be very beneficial. It could be used as training data for "helathy" participants for similar projects in the future. It would be interesting to see how a predictive model works for a psychological experiment like this.
